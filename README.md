<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is an implementation of a simple to-do list web application using Node.js and Express framework. The application has the following features:

- Adding an item to the to-do list - The application accepts a new item to be added to the list via a POST request.

- Displaying the to-do list - The current list of to-do items is displayed on the "/todo" page.

- Editing an item in the to-do list - The application allows the user to edit an existing item in the to-do list.

- Deleting an item from the to-do list - The user can delete an item from the to-do list by clicking on the "Delete" button next to the item.

The application listens on port 8000 and exports the "app" object to be used in other Node.js modules. Overall, this project is a simple example of how to build a web application using Node.js and Express with basic CRUD operations.
